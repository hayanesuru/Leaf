This patch is based on the following patch:
"Smarter statistics ticking"

* Hydrinity description *

In vanilla, statistics that count time spent for an action (i.e. time played or sneak time) are incremented every tick. This is retarded. With this patch and a configured interval of 20, the statistics are only ticked every 20th tick and are incremented by 20 ticks at a time. This means a lot less ticking with the same accurate counting.

With an interval of 20, this patch saves roughly 3ms per tick on a server w/ 80 players online.
