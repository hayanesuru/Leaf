Subject: [PATCH] Fish: Parallel World Ticking API

Original license: MIT
Original project: https://github.com/Biquaternions/Fish

This patch provides an API for performance monitoring plugins like PurpurBars.
A better approach would be to include an event when the world is done ticking,
  which will allow to re-use the RollingAverage logic from Spark and Minecraft internals.
However, since every fork developer will want to have said event into their own namespace,
  it will be virtually impossible to provide a universal API.
With this approach only new methods are added into already existing Bukkit API, and the same
  naming conventions as Bukkit were used, which means there's a bigger chance of this API to
  get standarized.
