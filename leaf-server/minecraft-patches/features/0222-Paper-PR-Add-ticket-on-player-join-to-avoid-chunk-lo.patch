Subject: [PATCH] Paper PR: Add ticket on player join to avoid chunk
 load-unload-load cycle

Original license: GPLv3
Original project: https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper
Paper pull request: https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/pull/11398

Adding the entity will add and then immediately remove an entity load ticket, which would result in the chunk loading and then unloading before being loaded again once the player chunk loader reacts (delay can vary based on rate limit configs)
By adding a ticket with a short removal delay we attempt to keep the chunk loaded until the player chunk loader reacts, but this is not a guarantee due to the aforementioned rate limit configs. Plugins should still handle load/unload events as normal, however this will reduce redundant calls.
The delay is currently set to 2 seconds, however, we may want to adjust this before merging (for example the player chunk unload delay is 5 seconds)

fixes Paper#9581
